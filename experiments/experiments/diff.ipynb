    "Diff Format:\n",

    "Each diff hunk should start with @@ lines (e.g., @@ - line_of_code / @@ + line_of_code) or a small chunk of context showing removed lines (-) and added lines (+).\n",
    "Keep diffs minimal. Only show lines that have changed, removed, or added.\n",
    "Logical Flow: The <SuggestedDiff> should naturally arise from the changes shown in the <HistoryDiffs>—e.g., continuing to rename a variable, refactor a method call, or fix a bug, etc.\n",
